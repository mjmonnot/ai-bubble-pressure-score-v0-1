# 📚 Research Background: Theoretical Foundations of the AI Bubble Pressure Score (AIBPS)

_Last updated: {{DATE}}_

The AI Bubble Pressure Score (AIBPS) draws on cross-disciplinary research spanning **behavioral finance**, **macroeconomics**, **organizational psychology**, **technological diffusion**, **innovation cycles**, and **computational sociology**. This document outlines the theoretical scaffolding behind the AIBPS framework and justifies its six-pillar structure with references to the academic literature.

# 1. Introduction

Speculative bubbles emerge when **valuation**, **liquidity**, **sentiment**, and **adoption expectations** decouple from underlying fundamentals. The AI sector—characterized by extraordinary capital concentration, rapid adoption cycles, infrastructure constraints, and intense narrative attention—exhibits structural features similar to previous historical bubbles (Kindleberger & Aliber, 2011; Shiller, 2015).

AIBPS operationalizes these constructs into a measurable system designed to track bubble pressure dynamically.

# 2. The Economics of Bubbles

## 2.1 Classic Bubble Definition  
The defining elements of a speculative bubble include:

1. **Displacement** (technological shock)  
2. **Credit expansion**  
3. **Euphoria**  
4. **Financial distress**  
5. **Revulsion and collapse**  

(Kindleberger & Aliber, 2011)

AI represents a *displacement event* with characteristics similar to railroads, electrification, radios, dot-coms, and crypto assets—each triggering investment cycles decoupled from steady-state fundamentals (Perez, 2002).

---

## 2.2 Behavioral Finance: Irrational Exuberance & Narrative Contagion  
Shiller (2015) identifies:

- **Overconfidence**
- **Herding**
- **Narrative amplification**
- **Feedback loops**

as central to speculative excess. Narrative contagion—especially around exponential technologies—amplifies valuations irrespective of cash flows.

The **Sentiment pillar** in AIBPS is grounded directly in this research, using large-scale public attention proxies as a quantitative operationalization of Shiller’s theory.

---

## 2.3 Financial Accelerator & Credit Cycles  
Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1996) demonstrate how **credit conditions amplify economic cycles**, especially in high-risk, innovation-driven sectors. When funding is cheap, speculative technologies accelerate; when credit tightens, fragility becomes exposed.

The **Credit pillar** maps this mechanism by capturing corporate funding stress (IG/HY spreads), which have historically preceded reversals in:

- late-1990s tech bubble  
- 2000–2001 dot-com unwind  
- 2007–2008 housing collapse  
- 2022–2023 tech recession  

---

# 3. Innovation, Adoption, and Technological S-Curves

Technological diffusion follows a canonical **S-curve** (Rogers, 2003). Early phases exhibit:

- High uncertainty  
- High narrative volatility  
- Overinvestment  
- Winner-take-all expectations  

AI tools (LLMs, GPU compute markets, enterprise AI deployment) currently occupy a **late-early / early-growth** position—where adoption signals, capex cycles, and sentiment diverge sharply.

The **Adoption pillar** in AIBPS maps to:

- Perceived adoption (survey-based)  
- Actual deployment (usage metrics, to be added)  
- Diffusion velocity  

---

# 4. The Psychology of Adoption, Hype, and Organizational Behavior

Because the user (Matthew Monnot, PhD) is an I/O psychologist, this section integrates **organizational science**—rarely referenced in bubble models but highly relevant to AI adoption cycles.

## 4.1 Expectancy & Perceived Value  
Vroom’s (1964) expectancy-value theory predicts that workers and firms adopt tools when expected value outweighs expected effort. Hype artificially inflates *perceived* value long before *actual* value materializes—creating adoption-sentiment divergences.

## 4.2 Social Proof and Mimetic Pressures  
Organizations copy perceived leaders (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983).  
In AI:

- "Every company needs an AI strategy"  
- "AI will 10× productivity"  

These narratives produce mimetic **overadoption pressure**, independent of ROI.

## 4.3 Hype Cycles & Human Cognition  
The Gartner Hype Cycle, while not purely academic, is rooted in:

- Novelty-seeking behavior  
- Overgeneralization  
- Availability heuristics  
- Illusory superiority  
- Bandwagon effects  

(see Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)

The **Sentiment pillar** and **Adoption pillar** jointly operationalize these psychological tendencies.

---

# 5. Infrastructure, Bottlenecks, and Real-Economy Constraints

AI development is unusually constrained by **physical infrastructure**:

- power generation  
- transmission  
- cooling  
- datacenter construction  
- semiconductor manufacturing  

Economic history shows that bubbles often end when **real-world bottlenecks collide with speculative expectations** (e.g., railroad bubbles of the 1840s; electrification; telecom bandwidth in 2000).

The **Infrastructure pillar** captures this friction region.

---

# 6. Capex Cycles and Overproduction

Overinvestment cycles are well studied:

- **Pigou cycles**  
- **Cobweb models** (Kaldor, 1934)  
- **Bullwhip effect dynamics**  
- **Boom-and-bust capex oscillations** (Jorgenson, 1963)

AI follows this pattern:

1. Demand shock (LLMs, inference, GPUs)  
2. Massive capex buildouts  
3. Supply glut or infrastructure saturation  
4. Price collapse or equilibrium correction  

The **Capex Supply pillar** maps these dynamics using PNFI, UNXANO, and planned industry-level indicators.

# 7. Multi-Pillar Systems and Composite Stress Indicators

Multidimensional bubble measures are more reliable than price-only signals.  
AIBPS draws on established composite-index traditions:

- Financial Conditions Index (FCI)  
- Chicago Fed National Activity Index  
- CB Leading Economic Index  
- Systemic Risk Index (SRISK)  
- Excess CAPE Yield (ECY)

AIBPS extends this framework specifically to **AI as a multi-sector ecosystem**, integrating:

- narrative economics  
- technological diffusion  
- real-economy constraints  
- cross-sector capex  
- financial liquidity  
- behavioral psychology  

This synthesis is novel in the literature.

# 8. Why Percentile / Rolling-Z / Sigmoid Normalization Works

Most economic variables drift upward over time. Rolling z-score normalization allows:

- cycle comparison  
- regime identification  
- preservation of local dynamics  
- resistance to structural breaks  
- alignment of pillars with different units  

Sigmoid transforms sharpen tail sensitivity—where bubbles emerge.

This mirrors methods used in:

- credit stress indicators  
- volatility-normalized trend indices  
- composite macro risk models

# 9. How This Literature Justifies the AIBPS Pillars

| Pillar | Literature Basis |
|--------|------------------|
| **Market** | Shiller (valuation + narrative contagion); speculative dynamics |
| **Credit** | Financial accelerator (Bernanke et al.); liquidity cycles |
| **Capex Supply** | Innovation cycles; overinvestment literature; Jorgenson |
| **Infrastructure** | Bottleneck-driven bubble reversals; tech-growth constraints |
| **Adoption** | Rogers diffusion; expectancy-value; organizational behavior |
| **Sentiment** | Narrative economics; behavioral finance; heuristics/biases |

Together, these reflect **the full bubble anatomy**: prices, liquidity, real economy, technology, psychology, and infrastructure constraints.
